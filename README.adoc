= rlox

This is a Rust implementation of an interpreter for the "lox" language from the excellent book "Crafting Interpreters" by Robert Nystrom.
The book is available online here: https://craftinginterpreters.com

The interpreter is complete up to and including chapter 11 ("Resolving and binding"),
but does not include classes etc. from chapter 12 onwards.

The code was written as an exercise in both Rust and interpreters while reading the book.
Rust enums-with-data have been used instead of the Visitor pattern, and some other details have been implemented a little differently than in the book.

I have tried not to be sloppy but the code has not been optimized much,
and there is room for improvement regarding performance (parameter passing is one such area).
