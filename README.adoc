= rlox

This is a Rust implementation of an interpreter for the "lox" language from the excellent book "Crafting Interpreters" by Robert Nystrom.
The book is available online here: https://craftinginterpreters.com@

The interpreter is complete up to and including chapter 11 ("Resolving and binding"),
but does not include classes etc. from chapter 12 onwards.
